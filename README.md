## Python Version

Python 3.6.0 



## Openssl Version

OpenSSL 1.0.2k  26 Jan 2017


## Operating System

Theoretically, this script should run when the requirements for Python version and Openssl version are met. But to set the record, this script was run on ```macOS 10.12```.


## Running the script

Run main.py using ```python main.py```. 

Upon running, the console asks for user input four times, the first two are for the key to be used in AES 128 ECB while the other two are for the AES 128 CBC. Enter 1234 for all the inputs.

The results of the encryption are written in separate files in```aes```, ```rsa```, ```sha``` directories inside the ```results``` directory.
